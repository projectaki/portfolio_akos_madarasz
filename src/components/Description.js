                        I have experience with the core elements of software development: working with agile and SCRUM,
                         design principles, code quality, testing, therefore I can use these skills, my motivation,
                          the drive to always improve/solve problems, to become a crucial member of any software development team.
                           In my free time I am studying and implementing data structures and algorithms and working on projects.
                            I am always working towards producing the best results I can, and I will bring the same mindset to any team I work with.
